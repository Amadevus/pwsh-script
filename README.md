In order to use this action, `script` input is required. The value of that input should be
the body of a PowerShell script.

The following variables are initialized before your script is executed:
- `$github` is an object representing the workflow's [`github` context]
- `$job` is an object representing the workflow's [`job` context]
- `$steps` is an object representing the workflow's [`steps` context]
- `$runner` is an object representing the workflow's [`runner` context]
- `$strategy` is an object representing the workflow's [`strategy` context]
- `$matrix` is an object representing the workflow's [`matrix` context]

Environment variables are accessed in the standard PowerShell way (`$env:my_var`).

**Note** This action requires `pwsh` to actually be available and on PATH of the runner - which
is the case for all GitHub-provided runner VMs; for your own runners you need to take care of that yourself.

This action has an extensive self-testing suite in [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Reading step results
The return value of the script will be made available in the step's outputs under the `result` key.
```yml
- uses: Amadevus/pwsh-script@v1
  id: my-script
  with:
    script: '1 + 1'
- run: echo "${{ steps.my-script.outputs.result }}"
  # should print 2
```

## Result encoding

If the script return value is a single string, it'll be set as the value of the `result` output directly.
In any other case, it'll be passed to `ConvertTo-Json $Value -Depth 100 -Compress -EscapeHandling EscapeNonAscii`
and the string result of that call will be set as the output value.
```yml
- uses: Amadevus/pwsh-script@v1
  id: bad-script
  with:
    script: return [ordered]@{ x = 'a1'; y = 'b2' }
  continue-on-error: true
- run: echo '${{ steps.bad-script.outputs.result }}'
  # should print {"x":"a1","y":"b2"}
```

## Error handling

If the script throws an error/exception, it'll be caught, printed to the log and the error message
will be set as an `error` output of the action.
```yml
- uses: Amadevus/pwsh-script@v1
  id: bad-script
  with:
    script: 'throw "this fails"'
  continue-on-error: true
- run: echo "${{ steps.bad-script.outputs.error }}"
  # should print 'this fails'
```

## Actions cmdlets
A module called `GitHubActionsCore` will be imported in the scope of your script. It provides commands
that are available for JavaScript Actions by [`@actions/core`] package, such as:
- `Add-ActionPath`
- `Write-ActionWarning`
- `Set-ActionFailed`

For module documentation, see [GitHubActionsCore README](docs/GitHubActionsCore/README.md).

The module has a good test suite written in Pester.

## Notes

- This action is written as a [`composite` action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-run-steps-action).
- Although available in the imported module, `Get-ActionInput` and `Set-ActionOutput` won't really work when used as part of this action.

## Examples

```yml
- uses: Amadevus/pwsh-script@v1
  id: script
  with:
    script: |
      Write-ActionDebug "This will be visible only when ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG secret is set"

      # we have access to full context objects:
      if ($github.event.repository.full_name -ne $github.repository) {
        throw "something fishy's going on, repos don't match" # will cause step to fail
      }

      $someData = Get-MyCustomData
      # this data may contain action-command-like strings (e.g. '::warning::...')
      # we can prevent interpreting these by GitHub by printing them in NoCommandsBlock:
      Invoke-ActionNoCommandsBlock -GenerateToken {
        Write-Host $someData # this won't result in any commands
      }
      # now we can send commands again

      # let's set env:BE_AWESOME=always, but for all the following actions/steps as well:
      Set-ActionVariable BE_AWESOME always

      # also we'll add path to our custom tool to PATH for the following steps:
      $toolPath = Resolve-Path ./tools/bin
      Add-ActionPath $toolPath

      # let's also warn if it's too late for people to work in Greenwich ;)
      if ([datetime]::UtcNow.Hour -ge 22) {
        Write-ActionWarning "It's time to go to bed. Don't write code late at night! âš "
      }
```
